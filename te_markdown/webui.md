Testing, on any level, is an indispensible quality assurance measure, yet is often neglected. Therefore, it is all the more important that the entry barrier to adopt a user acceptance test tool is as low as possible, both from the end user's perspective, as well as for maintainers and administrators providing technical support. Desktop applications require users to install them on their own machines, and may present administrators with the challenge of providing the latest updates.

**Test-Editor-Web** lives in the browser: once deployed, users can just be given a URL to type into their browser's address bar and start creating tests â€“ no need to install anything. When updates do become available, administrators can deploy them centrally; users do not have to take action, at all, and will just be presented with the latest version, the next time they open it.
