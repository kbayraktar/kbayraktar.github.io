Test-Editor-Web is a lightweight application for specifying, implementing, and executing user acceptance tests, that lives in your browser. This page provides a high-level [overview](#overview) of its user interface and its central components. If you would rather like to jump right in and try out Test-Editor-Web for yourself, have a look at one of the [quickstart tutorials](/te_markdown/tutorials). If any questions should arise, you may want to come back here to get your bearings by looking at the overview, or look up individual terms in the [glossary](#glossary) further down.

## Overview

<!--- TODO: insert (annotated?) overview image and briefly describe the main areas of the user interface -->

## Glossary

* Domain Expert
* Developer
* Test Case Language (TCL)
* Test-Editor-Web
* Test Specification Language (TSL)

<!--- TODO: write user-friendly definitions, layout the glossary as definition list with anchors for cross-referencing. The following is an example of how that might look:
<a name="domain-expert"></a>Domain expert
: A stakeholder and probably a user of the system under test, who has a deep understanding of the problem domain. Domain experts specify what they expect the system to do and how it should behave, using the [test specification language (TSL)](#test-specification-language).

<a name="developer"></a>Developer
: TBW

<a name="tester"></a>Tester
